            <h1>HTML & CSS Comment Tips</h1>
            <p>One valuable thing I have learned when starting any project is to include comments on your pages to
                provide a more structured layout.<br><br>

                For example, in HTML files, comments can be made with &lt;&excl;-- ---&gt; anything within that space
                won’t appear on the page or be read by the browser.<br>
                A good way to use this in a page is to outline your areas, like in the image below.<br><br>
            </p>
            <img src="images/htmltips.png" alt="image showing how to use comments in html" />
            <p>
                <br>
                Anywhere on your pages where you have a new section, you should use comments to outline what they are.<br><br>
                This helps in a few ways. First, it increases readability for yourself and anyone else reading your
                code. Second, as your projects grow, doing this helps keep them organized.<br><br>
                It’s easier to add to and edit when you can find the area where you want to make changes or add classes
                based on the comment tags rather than trying to narrow it down through many &lt;div&gt
                tags.<br>
                Third, it helps with remembering what you were doing.
                <br>
                <br>
                The same principles apply to CSS files, although comments are left in a CSS file type with /* */.<br>
                <br>
                </p>
                <img src="images/csstips.png" alt="image showing hot to use comments in css" />
                <p>
                    Using comments to outline the different style groups you intend to use in your projects can help you
                    find the parts you want to edit.<br>
                     In general, using comments is something everyone should do.<br><br> They
                    are very helpful in JavaScript and other languages when making notes about what a function does or
                    should be doing. You can also leave yourself notes about what you were working on.
